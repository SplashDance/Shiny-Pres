What's wrong with the status quo?
========================================================
incremental: true
title: true

The current approach to valuing a used car--by merely aggregating the results of thousands of transactions--has two *major* disadvantages:

1. __Time-Consuming__
    * It takes a lot of time to collect the necessary data.
1. __Expensive__
    * The data collection process itself can be extremely costly.


The Solution:
========================================================
type: prompt

The solution is to employ sophisticated machine learning techniques to distill
the main determinants of used-car prices and wrap these predictions in an
easy-to-use, portable application.



What We've Created:
========================================================

As a "proof-of-concept", we've used a dataset comprised of data from the sales of
various models of cars built by different General Motors cars from the 2005
model year.

  Mileage Cylinder Doors Cruise    Sound Leather index Brand        Type

2   13457        6     2    Yes  Premium Regular     2 Chevy       coupe

4   22479        4     2    Yes Standard Regular     4  Saab convertible
5   17590        4     2    Yes  Premium Leather     5  Saab convertible
6   23635        4     2    Yes Standard Regular     6  Saab convertible
```

Using the App:
========================================================

Using the App is simple and straightforward--simply click on the desired
attributes and let the shiny app predict the car's re-sale value automatically.
